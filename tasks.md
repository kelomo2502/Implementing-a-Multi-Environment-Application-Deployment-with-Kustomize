# Implementing-a-Multi-Environment-Application-Deployment-with-Kustomize

### 1. Hypothetical Use Case:
You are tasked with deploying a web application in a Kubernetes environment. The application will have different configurations for development, staging, and production environments. Your goal is to utilize Kustomize to manage these configurations efficiently and integrate the process into a CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. Tasks:
#### Task 1: Set Up Your Project:
- Create a new project directory named `kustomize-capstone`.
Inside the directory, structure it with Kustomize conventions: `base/` and `overlays/` (subdirectories for `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

### Task 2: Initialize Git:
- Initialize a Git repository in your `kustomize-capstone` directory.
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.

#### Task 3: Define Base Configuration:
- In the `base/` directory, define Kubernetes resources like Deployment, Service, etc., for your web application.
- Create a `kustomization.yaml` file in `base/` to include these resources.

#### Task 4: Create Environment-Specific Overlays:
- In each subdirectory of `overlays/`, create a `kustomization.yaml` that customizes the base configuration for that environment.
- Implement variations for each environment (e.g., different replica counts, resource limits, or environment variables).

#### Task 5: Integrate with a CI/CD Pipeline:
- Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Set up a pipeline that deploys your application using Kustomize. The pipeline should trigger on code changes.

#### Task 6: Test the CI/CD Pipeline:
- Make changes in your Kustomize configurations and push to your repository.
- Verify that the CI/CD pipeline correctly applies these changes to a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Task 7: Manage Secrets and ConfigMaps:
- Use Kustomize to generate ConfigMaps and Secrets. Ensure sensitive data is handled securely.
Apply these configurations in your overlays for different environments.

#### Task 8: Document Your Work:
- Create a `README.md` in your project explaining the structure and how to deploy the application using Kustomize.
- Include instructions for setting up and testing the CI/CD pipeline.
